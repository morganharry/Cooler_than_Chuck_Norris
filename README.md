Cooler than Chuck Norris

Description
Let's finish our encryption-decryption software by adding a simple user interface. The program asks the user for the desired option (encode/decode/exit), performs it, and all that in a loop until the user wants to finish.

Objectives
In this stage, your program should:

Ask users what they want to do, encode a string, decode a string or quit the program with
Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
If user inputs encode as the desired operation, the program should print Input string: to the output, read a line and output two lines — Encoded string: followed by the encoded string;
If user inputs decode as the desired operation, the program should print Input encoded string: to the output, read a line and output two lines — Decoded string: followed by the actual decoded string;
If user inputs exit as the desired operation, the program should say Bye! and finish its execution.
The program should be looped to terminate only if the user inputs exit as an operation. Otherwise, it should continue asking users Please input operation (encode/decode/exit): after each iteration.

Also, let's prevent some incorrect input.

If the user misspells the operation name, the program should print out There is no '<input>' operation
If the user provided an incorrect encoded message as input to decode, the program should print out appropriate feedback containing not valid substring
List of not valid encoded messages:

The encoded message includes characters other than 0 or spaces;
The first block of each sequence is not 0 or 00;
The number of blocks is odd;
The length of the decoded binary string is not a multiple of 7.
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Example 1:

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> encode
Input string:
> Hey!
Encoded string:
0 0 00 00 0 0 00 000 0 00 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 00000 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0 00 0000 0 0

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> decode
Input encoded string:
> 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 000 0 00 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 00000 00 00 0 0 00 0 0 0 00 0000 0 0
Decoded string:
Hey!

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> exit
Bye!
Example 2:

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> smile
There is no 'smile' operation

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> decode
Input encoded string:
> 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 000
Decoded string:
H

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> decode
Input encoded string:
> 0 0 1 00 0 0 1 000
Encoded string is not valid.

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> decode
Input encoded string:
> 000 0 00 00 0000 0 00 000
Encoded string is not valid.

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> decode
Input encoded string:
> 0 0 00 00 0 0 00
Encoded string is not valid.

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> decode
Input encoded string:
> 0 0 00 00 0 0 00 00
Encoded string is not valid.

Please input operation (encode/decode/exit):
> exit
Bye!
